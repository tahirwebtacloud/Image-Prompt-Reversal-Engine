# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## When to use this skill
- Before astarting any new feature or component.
- When the requirements are vague or high-level.
- To clarify user intent and constraints.
- To explore different architectural approaches.

## Workflow
[ ] Check current project state (files, docs, recent commits).
[ ] Ask clarifying questions (one at a time, preferably multiple choice).
[ ] Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs.
[ ] Present the design in small sections (200-300 words).
[ ] Validate each section with the user.
[ ] Save the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

## Instructions

**1. Understanding the Idea**
- Start by understanding the current project context.
- Ask questions **one at a time**.
- Prefer **multiple choice questions** to reduce user friction.
- Focus on purpose, constraints, and success criteria.

**2. Exploring Approaches**
- Always proposal 2-3 different approaches.
- Explain trade-offs for each.
- State your recommendation clearly.

**3. Presenting the Design**
- Break the design into small, digestible sections (200-300 words).
- Check for agreement after *each* section.
- Cover: Architecture, Components, Data Flow, Error Handling, Testing.

**4. Documentation**
- Once agreed, write the design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.
- Commit the design document.

**5. Handoff**
- Ask if the user is ready for implementation.
- Suggest using the `writing-plans` skill next.
